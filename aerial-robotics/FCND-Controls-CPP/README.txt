# FCND Term -1 P3 3D Quadrotor Controller #

## Project Overview ##

In the real world the flight controller is usually implemented in C or C++. So in this project you will implement your controller in C++. The code you write here can eventually be transferred to a real drone!

## PID Controller ##

 # Implementation 
 
  Following algorithms are implemented in QuadControl.cpp with changes in config in QuadControlParams.txt. Details of implementation are inline in code: 
  + Body Rate Controller
  + Roll Pitch Controller 
  + Attitude Controller 
  + Lateral Position Controller 
  + Yaw Controller 
  + Calculating Motor thrust and moments
