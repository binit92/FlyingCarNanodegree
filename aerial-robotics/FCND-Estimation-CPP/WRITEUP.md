Write up that includes all the rubric points

1. Determine the standard deviation of the measurement noise of both GPS X data and Accelerometer X data.

   The following log tracing from 06_SensorNoise.txt is creating two logs file */config/log/Graph1.txt* for GPS x location  and */config/log/Graph2.txt* accelerometer x velocity .  

   ```reStructuredText
   # graphing commands
   Commands += SetTitle(1,"GPS")
   Commands += Plot(1,Quad.GPS.X,"x position",0,1,1)
   Commands += AddGraph1.SigmaThreshold(Quad.GPS.X, Quad.Pos.X, MeasuredStdDev_GPSPosXY,64,73,2)
   Commands += AddGraph1.LogToFile
   
   Commands += SetTitle(2,"Accelerometer")
   Commands += Plot(2,Quad.IMU.AX,"x accel",.5,.7,1)
   Commands += AddGraph2.SigmaThreshold(Quad.IMU.AX, 0, MeasuredStdDev_AccelXY,64,73,2)
   Commands += AddGraph2.LogToFile
   ```

     I have simply added a python script under */script/sensor_noise.py* to calculate standard deviation for GPS and Accelerometer. Calculate values are : 

   ```
   GPS   : 0.6394973781911066
   Accel : 0.6394973781911066
   ```

   

2.  Implement a better rate gyro attitude integration scheme in the `updateFromIMU()` function.

   Running `config/07_AttitudeEstimation.txt`, the only sensor used is the IMU and noise levels are set to 0. On running this. 

   + the top graph is showing errors in each of the estimated Euler angles 

   + the bottom shows the true Euler angles and the estimates. There's quite a bit of error in attitude estimation.

   Changes are `QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp :: UpdateFromIMU()`. To reduce the errors in the estimated attitude (Euler Angels) with 0.1 rad, I have implemented a better rate gyro attitude integration schme tâ€‹     

3.  Implement all of the elements of the prediction step for the estimator.

4.  Implement the magnetometer update

5.  Implement the GPS update.
